# SensibleProgressView -  animatable!

This is a WORKING ProgressBar for iOS, derived from this neat demo https://github.com/huang-kun/ProgressViewDemo

I fought hard with the build in ProgressBar, and then iOS13 came out and nothing worked, so i decided to throw the build in one out and create a simple yet working and most importantly animatable ProgressBar.
